The goal of this project is to create a web based e-learning tool, which can  be used to visualize shortest path and sorting algorithms. Students as well as experienced people can sharpen their skills using this  tool.

# I.	INTRODUCTION

Visualization is a great way to learn any concept quicker than traditional methods. Today's technology lets in the advent of e-getting to know tools which are additionally useful within the development of computer technology training. The aim of this project is to create "Path-Finding Visualizer" and “Sorting Visualizer”, a web-based e-learning tool that can be used to visualize shortest paths and sorting algorithms. 
The implementation of the concept of this project is demonstrated by the use of algorithms such as Dijkstra, A* and DFS. This project aims to do all this with knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React Framework.
The final product is a web application so any user can easily see and learn how the algorithm works. The user-friendly version of the project provides users with simple instructions on how to work. Preliminary results of using the app show that the e-learning tool promises to provide students with a better understanding of the shortest path algorithm and various sorting algorithms.

# II. PROBLEM STATEMENT
“An algorithm must be seen to be believed.” are the famous words said by Donald Knuth, a computer scientist. This tool can help beginners and even experienced programmers to visualise algorithms in a better manner. It is an interactive UI to visualize few of the most popular sorting and path finding algorithms. The main purpose of creating this visualization tool is to make learning these skills easy and fast.
